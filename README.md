# The spigot development library to speed up development, readability and stability!
---
This plugin was created to further boost the speed of plugin development, officially made by **Efnilite**!

NOTE: **This doesn't make your code compile and run faster, it creates the ability for you to develop your plugin faster.**

## How do I use this?
You can use it in a variety of ways:

### Using Maven
Maven: pom.xml:
```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>

    </repository>
</repositories>


<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.efnilite</groupId>
